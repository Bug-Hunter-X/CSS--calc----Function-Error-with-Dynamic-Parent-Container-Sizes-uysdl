The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a potential error if you try to use it with percentages that depend on unknown parent container sizes.  For example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 10px);
}
```

If the parent container's width isn't set yet, or is determined dynamically, the calculation will fail, resulting in unexpected width behavior. The `calc()` function will produce unpredictable results and might not render correctly if the values it depends on haven't been computed.
